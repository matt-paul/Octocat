What is Git Clone?

Git clone makes an identical copy of an external git repository and transfers it to a local destination ready for modification.  This local repository is then used by the developer for further work, where he makes commit which are then pushed back to the 'origin' repository, which is the alias that git automatically gives to the URL of the repository that was cloned in the first place.
